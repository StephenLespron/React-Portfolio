		'Thank you for visiting my portfolio site. I have been developing since April 2020, and this site is intended to show my progression as a web developer and share a glimpse of my personality. Before developing, I had bounced around the    financial industry to make ends meet for my family. The COVID-19 pandemic caused many to find themselves unemployed; I was no exception. While terrifying, I took this as an opportunity to explore a new career that I have had an interest in for quite some time. I quickly found that I have never enjoyed working like I do development and I am eager to continue to improve my skills and let my passion be expressed in my work.',

	whyCoding:
		"Simply, I love solving problems. My dad was a brick-layer and being that wide-eyed son that looked up to his father, I wanted to do what he did. Except, he told me over his dead body would I become a mason. He wanted me to have an office job so I wouldn't break down physically as he did. But I loved construction, being on the job sites and making things from nothing. This pushed me into exploring Civil Engineering during college. Engineering really sparked my interest until I unexpectedly became a father. From there, I entered the financial industry as I could make decent money without a degree to support my family. But I always felt something was missing. In my roles, I would tinker with making small excel tools to help automate certain processes. It was from this practice that I had a manager point me in the direction of web development; which at the time, I knew hardly anything about. For a few years I explored various boot-camps and decided when life allowed, I would take the chance to develop a new skill and find a career that was fulfilling. And that that moment came in March of 2020 when I was cut from my job and forced to adapt. Since then, coding has become one of my favorite pastimes. There are tough moments, but nothing feels better than creating your own solution to a problem and watching it perform on screen. And it pushes me to want to the next challenge.",
	family:
		"I am recently married to my wife Alyssa. I have 1 son, Nathaniel from a previous relationship and another son on the way (Joshua)! These 3 drive me. Alyssa has always been my strength and encouragement, even before we began dating. Her confidence in me has always pushed me further than I always thought possible. Nathaniel has always been a blessing and he continuously teaches me lessons in kindness and valuing relationships with anyone we meet. Joshua is still a few months away, but I already melt every time I get to see him during my wife's doctor visits. Family is of the utmost importance to me. Everything I do, is in an effort to be the best dad/husband/son/brother/friend I can be.",
	interests:
		'I enjoy enjoying things. I have a wide net I cast when it comes to interests. Growing up, you would find me on a ball field somewhere nearly every night. I loved being a part of a team and building life long friendships. Even today, I continue to play slow-pitch softball with a few of my baseball friends. In addition to sports, I am an outdoorsman. Frequently throughout the year, you can find me, up north, in the trees camping, hiking, fishing and hunting. But as much as I love sports and outdoors, I can enjoy being on my computer or at my TV, escaping into the fantasy of various games. I especially enjoy jumping to League of Legends with my friends or MineCraft with my son.',
