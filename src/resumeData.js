	roleDescription:
		'Thank you for visiting my portfolio site. I have been developing since April 2020, and this site is intended to show my progression as a web developer and share a glimpse of my personality. Before developing, I had bounced around the    financial industry to make ends meet for my family. The COVID-19 pandemic caused many to find themselves unemployed; I was no exception. While terrifying, I took this as an opportunity to explore a new career that I have had an interest in for quite some time. I quickly found that I have never enjoyed working like I do development and I am eager to continue to improve my skills and let my passion be expressed in my work.',
